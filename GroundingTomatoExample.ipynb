    "How do we as humans learn what tomatoes are and what they mean to us? As humans we have five senses, which we use to percieve the world. \n",
    "These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Abbreviation | Sense |\n",
    "|:---------:|:-------|\n",
    "| Si | Sight |\n",
    "| He | Hearing |\n",
    "| Sm | Smell |\n",
    "| Ta | Taste |\n",
    "| To | Touch |\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers and Machine Learning(ML)/Deep Learning(DL) research currently use mainly two of the senses comparable with human senses to percive the world. These are [Si] and [He], enabled by availability of digital image, video and sound recordings. \n",

    "The Tomato example in this notebook lists human sensing and perception pairs as a challenge for AI and ML/DL systems to achieve general adult human level perception on tomatoes and their meaning.\n",

    "\n",
    "| Perception | Sensing involved | Context |\n",
    "|:---|:---:|:---|\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptions are assumed to be cumulative in nature, allowing learning based on multiple sequential or parallel perceptions.\n",
